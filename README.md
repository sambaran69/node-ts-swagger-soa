# node-ts-swagger-soa
Node.js, Typescript, Swagger API following clean architecture principles.

Enhanced by Inversify to enable dependency injection (DI)

I used [tsoa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsoa) for automatic Swagger doc generation, [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS) for DI, [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as server and enhanced it with [Typescript](typescriptlang.org)
